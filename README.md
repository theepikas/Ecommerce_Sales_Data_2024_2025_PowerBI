## 🧹 Data Pre-processing (Excel)

### Data Cleaning

* Verified dataset integrity and confirmed absence of duplicate records.
* Standardized textual inconsistencies in **Customer Name**, **Product Name**, and **Sub-Category** using:

  * Find & Replace
  * `TRIM()` for whitespace removal
  * `PROPER()` for consistent capitalization

---

### Missing Value Treatment

#### Categorical Variables

* Addressed null values in **Sub-Category** and **Payment Mode** using conditional imputation:

  * Replaced missing entries with "Unknown" and "Cash" respectively using `IF(ISBLANK())`.

#### Numerical Variables

* **Quantity:**

  * Imputed using conditional mean (`AVERAGEIF()`) based on relevant criteria
  * Standardized values using `ROUND()`

* **Unit Price:**

  * Derived missing values using a business rule:

    ```
    Unit Price = Total Amount / (Quantity × (1 - Discount))
    ```

---

### Feature Engineering

* Extracted **Order Month** and **Order Year** from the Order Date column to enable time-series analysis.

---

### Data Structuring & Validation

* Sorted dataset by **Order ID** in ascending order.
* Applied filtering techniques to validate cleaned data and ensure consistency.

---

### Statistical Analysis

* Leveraged Excel’s **Data Analysis ToolPak** to compute:

  * Sum, Mean, Median, Mode, Skewness
* Applied across key variables:

  * Quantity, Unit Price, Discount, Sales, Profit
